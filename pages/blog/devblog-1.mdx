* Merch Partnerships
* Community Fund

## ‚ú® Intro

The project has been in existence for about 150 days. We want to say a big thank you to everyone who currently takes part in the development of the project.

We will try to attract more creative, popular and technical people to our project to grow as quickly as possible.




## üìª Breaking News 

Head Of Marketing is left our team by own decision. This position will be taken by the CTO Alyx Dow for the time being, and then a new marketing team will be formed. At this point, we will be focusing on technically expanding the utility of our NFTs.


## üß¢ Official Dope Shibas Merch Are Coming

[Maddies](https://maddies.co) is an online store that helps sell branded items by the NFT collections. They already had partnerships with Bored Apes Yacht Club, Cool Dogs, Cool Cats, as well as many other super-popular collections, now it's our time.

At the moment we are negotiating with the Maddies to become official partners as other collections and sell branded clothing & items for our holders. All profits that will be made from the sales of Dope Shibas branded items will go to the Community Fund.

## üí∏ Community Fund

There will be a new community fund formed based on Open Zeppelin smart contracts called **Governor**, which allows you to vote using the project's ERC20 & ERC721 tokens. This smart contract allows you to manage the fund much more decentralized than it is at the moment via the delegators system. Right now we are using the gasless Snapshot voting system, which does not inspire the necessary confidence and don't allows build transactions.

With the new system, money can be distributed more transparently and people will be able to see all the detailed voting histories and the current state of the project budget.

## üè° Work In Progress

 Now let's move on to the present and see what we are doing at the moment. We're sure you're going to love this news.

### Samurai Shibas Collection

The Samurai Shibas is a mock parody, or derivative of our main collection, drawn by our artist Bomo.

Bomo was already famous for drawing Pepe's replacement toad hat to avoid copyright issues from Matt Fury.

We are currently working on the technical functionality of our new optional collection. Samurai Shibas will be a sequel to the story of Shibas, but in the era of the Japanese emperors... The action will move to Japan, the themes will become more interesting, the characters' characteristics will become many. 

The collection will be released between the end of the fourth quarter of 2021 and the beginning of the first quarter of 2022.

You are waiting for a unique system for obtaining tokens, which you have already seen on popular projects like Meka Verse with slight modifications.

### Dope Shibas: Metaverse

Dope Schibas plans to release his game in the first quarter of 2022. This game will be a metaverse in the style of Animal Crossing. Each of the 10,000 Dope Shibas will be translated into a 3D format that will be available play for every token holder. In the Q1 to Q2 2022 we will add the support of the Samurai Shibas collectible.

The game will be a large game world with a bunch of islands on which land token owners will be able to place their game objects, like Cryptovoxels or Decentraland. There will also be basic infrastructure facilities where people can earn tokens to manage the Dope Shibas project via new Governor module.
